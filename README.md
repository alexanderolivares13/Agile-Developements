# Agile-Developements

## Description

- This project was created to serve as an online portfolio to host my various projects I will be working on throughout my growth as a full stack developer, and even after as I continue to improve. I built this project to help me apply the concepts that I've learned throughout my first few weeks in my bootcamp, and I was able further to challenge myself by taking on this project and learning to problem solve any issues that surfaced alone the way. By the end I learned much more about flexbox and how to properly apply the properties within the code to make it responsive and match the vision that I had in mind.
