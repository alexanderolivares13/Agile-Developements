                        Greetings! Welcome to my portfolio!<br>
                        My name is Alexander Olivares, for the majority of my professional career I have worked in the Supply Chain & Logistic areas.<br> 
                        For the past decade I have had an interest in web design, programming and software developement. <br>
                        However, recently I have decided to pursue my passion.<br>My goal is to learn enough about programming to be able to build a functioning chess engine and analysis board.<br> Click any of the labels on the boxes below to view my all of my recent completed projects.
                    </p>
